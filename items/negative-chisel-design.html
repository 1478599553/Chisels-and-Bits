title: Negative Chisel Design
---
<p>Have you ever make a design in stone and wished you had made it out something more ostentatious, Say diamond or gold? Well then the negative chisel design is probably for you, allowing you to capture the negative space of the block you can apply it to other blocks of any material. You can also craft one with a second blank negative chisel design to invert the space allowing you to make 'Casts'.</p>
