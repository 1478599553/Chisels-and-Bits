<p>A Minecraft mod about creating endless custom decorations using in game materials.</p>

<p>Well that's pretty broad, but its accurate, C&amp;B takes existing blocks in your game world and lets you manipulate them together to create new custom creations, sculpting, copying, sawing, rotating, measuring and building is all possible at a micro-scale.</p>

<p>Along with providing basic decoration C&amp;B also optionally supports <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/mcmultipart">MC Multipart</a>, which allows you to use C&amp;B in the same block space as other mods that are <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/mcmultipart">MCMP</a> Compatable.</p>

<p>Are you lacking in materials? Need various shades to work with? Look no further than <a href="http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/flat-colored-blocks">Flat Colored Blocks</a></p>

<p>The possibilities are virtually endless.</p>
